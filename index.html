            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Our application Smart budget will present the user with a series of
                scenarios, each prioritizing a specific spending category. The user will input their income and the amount 
                of money they would like to set aside. They will then choose their ideal scenario, and
                their money will be allocated into the  7 spending categories: food, personal expenses,  
                medical expenses, utilities, emergency, education and savings . 
                The money set aside by the user will be allocated into 
                a user made or chosen category (Feature to come in a later build).</h5>
